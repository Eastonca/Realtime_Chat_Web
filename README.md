## ✨ About the Project

### Key Features
- 💬 Realtime messaging between connected users
- ⚡ Instant broadcasting with websockets
- 🔒 User join and leave notifications
- 📡 Backend server with Node.js & Express

The goal was to strengthen my skills in **websocket communication**, **full-stack development**, and **real-time event handling** — all tied together in a single interactive app.
